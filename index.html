                                <p>
                                    As a project to complete in my free time I created an autonomous robot using multiple
                                    <strong>ultrasonic sensors</strong> in combination with an <strong>Arduino Microcontroller</strong> and a robot vehicle chassis.
                                    I was able to experiment with a variety of concepts such as <strong>Analog vs. Digital, Sensor Interfacing,
                                    Motor Control</strong>, and many more. My <strong>troubleshooting</strong> skills were also heavily enhanced as there were a variety
                                    of problems I was forced to overcome through perseverance when testing the robot for functionality.
                                </p>
                                <div class = "row">
                                    <div class = "col-md-6">
                                        <h4>
                                            Sensors
                                        </h4>
                                        <p class = "content-body">
                                            In order to provide the robot with a solid sense of awareness for its surroundings, I equipped it 
                                            with 3 ultrasonic sensors. One sensor was placed at the front, whereas the other two were placed
                                            facing right and left. This allowed the robot to have a sense of whether there were objects directly
                                            ahead of it, as well as if there were any objects on its side.
                                            The sensors simply returned a number representing how long it took for the ultrasonic wave to bounce
                                            off the nearest object and return to the sensor. I then used this number along with a combination of 
                                            the calculated speed of sound (according to the specified temperature) to calculate the distance to the
                                            nearest object.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class = "content-body">
                                            The path planning for this robot was a simple control flow algorithm to determine the robots'
                                            actions dependant on its surroudings. The data received from each of the sensors was processed
                                            and operated on to determine the distance from the front of the vehicle 
                                            to the nearest object, and then used to
                                            essentially stitch together a basic understanding of the robots' current surroundings.
                                            Dependant on the proximity of the nearest object at the front, or the nearest object at the left
                                            or right side, the robot would control its motors such that it moves away from any obstructions

                                    travelling. Controlled the motors to the arduino board using an L293D chip. If both
                                    sensors read high, then the robot travelled forward along the line. If the robot
                                    veered to the side and was not completely on the line, then one sensor would read
                                    high whereas the other would read low, causing the motors to act accordingly and
                                    readjust so that the line is between the sensors once again.</p>

                                <p>As a project to complete in my free time I decided to create a binary counter. The
                                    counter consists of two 7 segment display chips, an NE555 chip, an 74LS90 chip, and
                                    two CD4056BE chips. The NE555 chip acted as the interval setter between number
                                    changes as its resistances could be changed to increase or decrease the time between
                                    numbers. The 74LS90 chip is a decade counter, which had the job of counting from 0-9
                                    in binary cyclically, and the binary counted was displayed by lighting up the
                                    appropriate LEDs. The CD4056BE chip acted as a digital display driver, as it intook
                                    the binary signals from the 74LS90 chip and converted them into digital signals,
                                    which were then relayed to the seven segment displays in order to display the
                                    numbers.</p>

                                <p class="item-intro text-muted">Built a VEX Robot to compete in a robotics challenge
                                </p>

                                <p>Incorporated a variety of engineering elements including mechanical design, computer
                                    engineering, as well as software engineering in order to create this robot. Built
                                    the base of the robot using a design process to initiate the design, and further
                                    build it using metal. Decided upon the optimal method for the functionality of the
                                    robot, which was then implemented into the design as the main component of the
                                    robot. Connected the components of the robot to the VEX brain of the robot, which
                                    was then programmed in order to control the motors. Program the remote control in
                                    order to control the motors, further controlling the motion of the robot. The
                                    overall objective of the challenge was to lift balls using the robot and place them
                                    on the opponent's side to score points. In order to perform this task with peak
                                    efficiency, my team built the robot using a catapult/platform type functionality so
                                    that it could lift multiple balls at a time and toss them onto the opponent's side,
                                    to score multiple points at once.</p>

                                            My role in this project was that of a <strong>backend developer</strong>.
                                            I took on the tasks of developing the backend server and implementing
                                            HTTP requestmethods for the front-end application to communicate with the server.
                                            I developed a <strong>flask</strong> web server to allow communication
                                            between the app and the database. Along with the server I developed a 
                                            REST Api, implementing a variety of HTTP requests to fulfill actions for the application
                                            . My database of choice was MongoDB, as I love its 
                                            flexibility and storage formats.

                                            I had a certain solution scoring better than the other that I decided to proceed forward with.

                                            With my solution now in mind, I started with a <strong>low-fidelity prototype</strong> of the solution.
                                            I didn't begin with a wireframe, but rather with a diagram showing the architecture of 
                                            the application and the connections between each of the components. Once I had the functionality
                                            of the product planned out, I moved onto some UI low-level prototypes by just sketching out some interfaces.
                                            I'm currently in the medium-fidelity stage as my product isn't quite ready for production, but it is 
                                            approaching a level of full functionality.

                                            <strong>MongoDB</strong> was used as the database of choice, the main reason being

                                    and what accessories to bring with them when they go outside.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Purpose</h4>
                                <p>
                                    This application hopes to to advise users of the weather conditions and
                                    suggest an ideal outfit so that they are prepared for the weather conditions. A
                                    clean and simple UI was designed to make it easy to use. Users can enter their
                                    location, and the app will then proceed to display details on the weather, as well
                                    as a possible outfit to wear from top to bottom. A variety of display design principles
                                    were used in designing the display such as <strong>Norman's' Seven Stages of Action</strong>.
                                    These principles helped us design an interface to ensure easy interpretation for users,
                                    as well as easy execution of the action they would like to perform.

                                <p>
                                    Python's <strong>Flask</strong> framework was used to develop the backend of this
                                    web application. User inputted data was sent to the <strong>OpenWeather API</strong>
                                    to retrieve weather information for the specified city. <strong>Jinja2</strong>
                                    was then used to inject data into the HTML.
